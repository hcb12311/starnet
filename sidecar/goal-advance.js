/* sidecar/goal-advance.js — the PURE engine that lets the SIDECAR move the Commander's plan forward.

   WHY THIS EXISTS — the goal tree lives in the webview (frontend/app/goalstore.js) and the sidecar only held a
   one-line summary of it (goal text, done/total, the next step). Quest refresh mints quests bound to that next
   step (goalId + milestoneId), and the contract sweeps complete them with the window closed — but nothing ever
   told the plan the step was finished. The mirror kept naming the same step, the next refresh planned it
   again, and the progress bar never moved. This module closes that loop with two pure reads:

     · slateFinished(goal, quests) — every quest planned for the CURRENT step is resolved (none open) and at
       least one of them was actually completed by its contract. That is the step's evidence: the station
       planned the step as a set of verifiable quests and every one of them is settled. A slate that was only
       dismissed proves nothing and never advances.
     · overlay(goal, doneKeys) — fold the durable journey's recorded milestone completions onto the mirrored
       tree and recompute done/total/pct and the next open step. The journey ledger is the monotonic truth, so
       a stale push from a webview that has not seen the completion yet can never walk the plan backwards.

   A finished plan step is evidence of work, never proof the life goal happened (journey-store's rule): the
   goal stays active until the Commander confirms its success condition. No Date.now / fs / network here — the
   host (sidecar/index.js) injects the stores and the clock. */
