/* sidecar/browser-view.js — THE STATION BROWSER: one built-in browser the Commander and the agents SHARE.

   WHY THIS EXISTS (Andrew, 2026-09-30, after trying the first cut: "the agent is not using the built in browser or
   controlling it at all, and cant see anything"). The first cut gave every run its own private Chrome that died with
   the run, and the Commander a second browser nobody else could see — so "open YouTube" happened in a browser that
   was gone by the time you looked, and "do you see Google?" was asked of a browser that never had it. The model
   people expect (Claude Code's browser pane, Codex's in-app browser) is ONE browser:

     · the agent DRIVES it — an interactive (COMMS) run's browser.* tools are bound to this session, not a private one;
     · it is a REAL Chrome window on the Commander's screen (index.js: preferVisible) — they use it natively, and the
       BROWSER window in the station mirrors and controls it (a live picture, an address bar, bring-to-front);
     · the Commander WATCHES the agent drive it, during the run and after it (it stays open);
     · the Commander USES it between runs — a typed address, clicks and keys go to the same page the agent will see;
     · it holds the ONE durable station profile, so a sign-in made here — by either of you — is there next time.

   ONE DRIVER AT A TIME. While a run is driving, the Commander's input is refused (they watch); taking the wheel
   mid-run is STEP-IN's handoff (browser-handoff.js) and nothing else. When nobody is driving, the Commander drives.
   A second interactive run that starts while another is driving gets a private per-run browser exactly as before
   (sessionForRun returns null), and so does every unattended run (cron, night shift, channels).

   THE PROFILE LEASE. The durable profile is a single-owner lease. The station browser holds it while open and NEVER
   gives it up to another run (Andrew: it "constantly closes" — a browser closing under you is the bug): a run that
   loses to it browses on a temporary profile instead (index.js browserProfileLeaseFor → fallback). A VISIBLE station
   browser never idles out (the Commander may be using the window directly, which the station cannot see): it closes
   when they close it. Only a headless one (STARNET_BROWSER_HEADLESS) closes after half an hour unused. If the window
   is closed or Chrome dies, the next use starts it again on the same profile (browser.js reviveIfDead).

   LAWS
     · Truthful telemetry: `open` means the session really has a browser; `driver` is the run bound right now;
       `remembered` is the session's own profile answer. The address shown is the one Chrome reports.
     · No agent receives anything from here: frames and input flow between the station page and Chrome only.
     · Every ref dies when the browser changes hands (session.handTo): the page may be one the Commander opened.
     · Pure: clock and timers are injected; the composition root (index.js) supplies them. */

               and paste there natively). The BROWSER window follows it. Where no window can open (no screen, no
               Chromium-family browser installed, or a headless pin) the station browses built-in and says so;
     builtin — hidden inside StarNet: the BROWSER window is the browser; nothing opens on the desktop;
