/* sidecar/auxgovernor.js — the PURE AUX-SPEND GOVERNOR for the post-run seam (aux-budget lane).

   THE PROBLEM THIS CLOSES: after ONE hot task run, up to SIX independent aux model passes can fire
   (sidecar/index.js run-end: reflection · study · thread-mine · scout-cycle · skill-review · skill-curator).
   Each has its OWN salience gate + cooldown + cost cap — good in isolation — but there was NO JOINT ceiling:
   a single substantive run could touch off five or six billable model calls back-to-back, and no test bounded
   the aggregate. This module is the one JOINT decision: given the passes whose OWN gates already cleared THIS
   run-end (the candidates), a priority order, and a budget, it decides which passes may SPEND and which are
   DEFERRED. It NEVER fires anything and holds NO state — the ambient half (reading the gates, firing the
   granted passes, logging the deferrals) lives in sidecar/index.js.

   PRIORITY is LOCKED to the product's beat order (highest first):
     reflection > failure-review > study > threadmine > scout > skill-review > skill-curator
   so when the budget is scarce the station keeps the turn-in beat + belief updates the Commander actually sees,
   and yields the quieter background passes to the NEXT qualifying run. (failure-review fires only on FAILED
   run-ends, where reflection never qualifies — the two are mutually exclusive per run, never rivals.)

   DEFERRED ≠ SUPPRESSED: a deferred pass simply is not fired this run-end; the caller arms NO cooldown for it,
   so its own gate re-qualifies and it retries on the next run. Truthful telemetry: the caller records the
   deferral (which passes yielded) so a reader can see the ceiling bit, not just its effect.

   DETERMINISM SPLIT (mirrors nightshift.js / nightfocus.js / cron-store.js): every function here is a pure
   transform over its inputs — NO Date.now / new Date() / Math.random / performance.now / fs — so it passes
   test/lint-determinism.js and is headless-testable. There is no `now` parameter because the decision has no
   time dependence: the caller has ALREADY resolved each pass's own time-based gate before handing us the
   candidate list. */

  //                run-end to the higher beats. A reserved name that is not a candidate spends nothing.
