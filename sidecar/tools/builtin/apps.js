/* sidecar/tools/builtin/apps.js — the crew's side of APPS (sidecar/apps.js).

   The Commander describes an app in their own words (a tracker, a timer, a dashboard, a game…); the lead builds it:
     app.create    a new app (the APPS window's NEW APP does this for the Commander; the tool is for "make me an app…" in chat)
     app.read      what an app is made of: its files, its data keys, its schedule — or one file / one data value
     app.write     write one page file (index.html …) — the open window reloads onto it at once
     app.check     compile its scripts and look-check it against the station style (never runs anything)
     app.publish   put data into the app (what its page shows) — scheduled refreshes end with this
     app.schedule  refresh it on a schedule ("every 24h", "0 8 * * *") with a task; "off" stops it
   All of it is inert until a page draws or a routine runs: the page is a network-less sandbox, and the scheduled
   task is an ordinary routine under the station's normal rules. So none of these ask first. */

const GUIDE = [
  'HOW A STARNET APP WORKS (keep to this):',
  '- A StarNet app lives INSIDE StarNet. If the Commander asked for something to host, ship or run elsewhere (a website for Netlify, a React project, a script, an extension), this was the wrong tool: build real files instead, and tell the Commander this empty app can be removed from APPS.',
  '- The app is ONE page: index.html (put CSS/JS inline or in style.css / app.js beside it). It opens in a StarNet window.',
  '- IT IS THE COMMANDER\'S APP — it can be ANYTHING: a dashboard, a tracker, a calculator, a timer, a game, a canvas toy. If they describe a look, layout, colours, fonts, animation or behaviour, build EXACTLY that with your own CSS/JS/canvas/SVG — their wish beats the station style. Only when they did not say how it should look, make it native:',
  '- DEFAULT LOOK (no look asked for): the station kit is injected automatically — build with its classes so the app looks native: sn-stack · sn-row-flex · sn-grid · sn-panel · sn-card · sn-sect (▮ header strip) + sn-list/sn-item rows · sn-stats/sn-stat (<b>value</b><span>LABEL</span>) · sn-table · sn-badge · dot ok|warn|bad · sn-title · sn-label · sn-hint · sn-muted · sn-btn (.primary .xs) · sn-input · sn-select · sn-tabs/sn-tab.on · sn-empty · sn-loading · sn-error. Colours via var(--ph), rgba(var(--ph-rgb),.2), var(--ok) --bad --warn; the page background stays transparent (the window glass shows through).',
  '- INTERACTIVE apps keep the Commander\'s own input with starnet.store.set(key, value) / starnet.store.get(key) / starnet.store.delete(key) / starnet.store.keys() (JSON, saved on the station, survives reloads) — a tracker, a to-do, settings, a high score. Never localStorage (the sandbox has none).',
  '- Hard limits (the sandbox, not a style rule): the page has no network and loads nothing from the web (no CDN scripts, web fonts or remote images — inline everything, draw with CSS/SVG/canvas, images only as data: URIs); files are text.',
  '- TIME: your own sense of today\'s date is WRONG (it is your training era). app.read states the station\'s real date — anything current (news, prices, "today") is searched for THAT date, and every item you publish is from it.',
  '- The page has NO network: it never fetches anything. Its content is DATA you publish with app.publish(app, key, value) — any JSON (e.g. key "items": [{ title, detail, url }]).',
  '- In the page: const data = await starnet.store.get("items"); render it; and re-render when new data lands: starnet.onData(async () => { … }). Show an empty state (sn-empty) until the first data arrives, and a small "updated <time>" line (data._meta is kept by the station: await starnet.store.get("_meta") → { updatedAt }).',
  '- Links: a plain <a href="https://…"> opens in the Commander\'s browser (the station catches the click) — just link. Never put a URL inside an inline onclick="…" attribute (its quotes break the attribute); for a whole clickable row, wrap it in the <a>.',
  '- AUTOMATION: an app can update itself on any cadence ("every 15m", "every 1h", "0 8 * * *"). Each update is a crew run doing the `task` — publishing fresh data AND/OR changing the page itself (a new layout each week, a theme that follows the season). The Commander can also set or change this from AUTO-UPDATE under the app. Anything that must tick live (a clock, a timer, an animation) the page does itself in JS — never a run per second.',
  '- If it should update by itself (daily, hourly…), call app.schedule with `every` and the `task` each refresh performs (e.g. "gather what the crew finished this week and publish it with app.publish key items"). Schedule FIRST, before you search or read anything from the web; then do the first refresh yourself (do the task, app.publish) so the Commander sees real content immediately.',
  '- Build order: app.read → app.schedule (if it updates by itself — do this BEFORE any web research, or the station asks the Commander to approve it) → app.write index.html → app.check → research → app.publish real data. Tell the Commander in one or two sentences what the app does and when it refreshes.'
