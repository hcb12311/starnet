/* sidecar/tools/builtin/deliverable.js — the agent NAMES its own finished work.

   A run's artifacts ledger already proves WHAT files were written (sidecar/artifacts.js, folded from real tool
   results). What it cannot know is what the work was FOR: "output.md" is a true name and a useless one. This tool
   lets the agent supply the missing prose — a plain-English title, a one-line description, and which file is the
   point — so the Deliverables library can show a person what they got instead of a basename.

   THE LINE THIS TOOL EXISTS TO HOLD: the agent may NAME and DESCRIBE its work. It may never ASSERT that the work
   is complete, correct, verified, or that anyone else helped. Status, crew, byte counts and timings are harness
   truth, derived elsewhere (runstore + deliverable-provenance) and rendered as pills the prose cannot contradict.
   So the accepted keys are an allowlist of four, and everything else a model sends is dropped in silence rather
   than honored. A model that passes status:'kept' or verified:true must have those keys VANISH — if they could
   ride through, this tool would become the app's most convincing lie surface, because the deliverables card is
   the surface a user trusts most.

   The description below is deliberately worded to ask for a DESCRIPTION, never a VERDICT. "Say what it is" gets a
   noun phrase; "summarize what you completed" gets a claim, and the card would carry a sentence the harness
   cannot back.
