/* sidecar/budgetcaps.js — the PURE resolve+validate helper behind the SETTINGS → Budget panel (P0-2).
   Splits the two decisions out of the Node host so they're testable headlessly:

   • resolveCaps(envDefaults, overrides) -> effective caps. PRECEDENCE (additive, never breaks an env deploy):
     a persisted override wins for a key; else the env default. An override value of 0 is a REAL saved choice
     ("no cap" / ungoverned) and beats a non-zero env default — so the UI can dial a cap OFF. An override key
     that is absent means "use the env default" (that's how RESET works: clear the override, fall back to env).

   • validateOverridesPatch(patch) -> { ok, overrides?, error? }. Strictly parses an incoming
     { perRun?, perAgent?, perDay?, global? } patch against the current-nothing baseline: each present value must
     be a finite number >= 0 (0 = no cap) under a sane ceiling, or null/'' to CLEAR that key back to its default.
     Returns the SET of keys to persist (absent = cleared). No IO, no clock — trivially testable. */

     its first model call. With no per-run cap in force, admission used to reserve the ENTIRE wallet — and the
     reservation is the loop's per-run ceiling — so one "simple" prompt on a busy/expensive model was allowed to
     spend every dollar the user had just added (reporter: $10 top-up gone on a four-sentence question).
     Now a managed run with no positive per-run cap reserves at most this much. Why $2: the smallest top-up is
     $10, so one prompt can take at most a fifth of it; a simple question costs cents and a real multi-step task
     on a mid-tier model rarely passes a dollar; it is well under the $25/day rail so the day rail stays the
     backstop, not the first thing a user hits. It is a DEFAULT, not a wall: any per-run cap the user saves in
     SETTINGS → BUDGET (higher or lower) replaces it, the stop says which cap it hit and opens BUDGET, and
     SKYNET_BUDGET_MANAGED_PER_RUN retunes it (0 = the old wallet-is-the-ceiling behaviour). BYOK and
