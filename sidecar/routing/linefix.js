/* sidecar/routing/linefix.js — NOT RIGHT? (2026-09-30, ease of use; Andrew: "if the output is terrible and not consistent I am
   wondering how the user can properly correct it and give it better context … how the user can fix the conveyor system to their
   liking of the output they are looking for").

   A Commander who got a result they don't want says what is wrong in plain words; this turns that into CONCRETE changes to the
   line's step instructions — which step's DOES (its standing brief) or HANDS OFF (what it hands on) to rewrite, and why — for
   them to accept or skip one by one in the Workflow panel. Nothing is changed here: accepting a fix is the panel's ordinary brief
   edit (one undo), and the proof it worked is running the same job again.

   PURE (no IO, no clock): normalizeInput checks and bounds what the panel sent (the job, the result, what each step was told and
   what it produced), buildPrompt writes the ONE model prompt, parseFixes reads the model's JSON back and keeps only fixes that
   name a step of THIS line and actually change something. The caller (index.js handleRoutingFixSuggest) makes the one billed
   model call on the station's default model and books its spend. */
