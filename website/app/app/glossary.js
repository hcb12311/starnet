/* STARNET — glossary.js : the one place the station explains its own words to a first-minute user.

   A pure term -> one-sentence map, consumed by hint.js (data-hint="<term>" tooltips). Copy law:
   lowercase station voice, eerie-not-cute, one plain sentence a beginner can act on. Every entry
   is grounded in how the term is ACTUALLY used in the code (marketplace.js / autonomy.js / stationui.js
   / returnstore.js) — not an aspirational definition. Keys are lowercased on lookup, so
   data-hint="REFIT" and data-hint="refit" resolve the same entry.

   UMD: a `Glossary` global in the browser; module.exports under node/tests. No DOM, no deps. */

    // the conveyor builder's own word (2026-09-27 audit F1): what a WORKFLOW is, in the order work meets it
    workflow:     'several agents chained on conveyor belts — work comes in at the INBOX, each BAY is one agent doing one step, and the result comes out at the OUTBOX.',

    loop:         'one objective an agent keeps working at, stopping each time for your yes or no — UNTIL it is done, not on a clock. Your verdict is what starts the next pass; it costs nothing while it waits. Manage them under ∞ AUTOMATION.',
    recipe:       'a ready-made job an agent can run right now — WHAT to run; launching one lands it on MY WORK › TASKS.',
    task:         'a planned piece of work created on the board or launched from a recipe or goal — it appears on MY WORK › TASKS and opens as a COMMS session.',
    quest:        'a suggestion or progress marker from the station — accepting one starts real work; it is never a second to-do list.',
    skill:        'something an agent CAN do — some skills only switch on once their gear is on station. Browse them under CONNECT › ABILITIES ▸ SKILL LIBRARY.',
    toolset:      'a family of tools you can switch on or off for agents (web, files, terminal…) — the switches live in CONNECT › ABILITIES › BUILT-IN ABILITIES.',
    capability:   'the same tool families as TOOLSETS, read-only — what an agent is equipped with right now; each agent’s readout is the SKILLS tab of its dossier.',
    connector:    'an outside service you plug IN so agents can use it as a tool (calendar, Slack actions, databases).',
    app:          'something your crew built for you in its own window — a dashboard, a tracker, a tool, a game. Describe it (or a change) in plain words; it can refresh itself on a schedule.',
