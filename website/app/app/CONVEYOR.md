# Conveyor system — contract

Directional conveyor belts you lay like a path, with boxes that flow along them. Companion to
`BUILDER.md` / `PROPS.md`. Built on the props infrastructure; additive (no `shared/` change).

## Data model (worldmodel.js)

Belts are a first-class keyed layer (NOT props) — a conveyor is a graph, and transport needs
O(1) topology lookups:

```js
doc.belts = { "12,7": "E", "13,7": "E", "13,8": "S", ... }   // "x,y" (WORLD tile) -> dir
```

- `dir` ∈ `E|W|N|S` — the flow direction OUT of that tile. 1×1 tiles.
- Belts are **walkable** — they never enter `blockedTiles`. A belt is floor machinery; boxes
  ride above it. This keeps pathfinding robust across a factory floor.

Mutations (snapshot undo/redo): `setBelt(x,y,dir)`, `removeBelt(x,y)`, `placeBeltRun(a,b)` (lays a
straight run from a→b, direction = the drag axis). Validation: each tile must sit on a deck
(`roomAt != null`) and not on a *blocking* prop. Reads: `belts()` (→ `[{x,y,dir}]`),
`beltAt(x,y)` (→ dir|null). `projectGeometry()` emits `belts` in the LOCAL frame; belts serialize
inside `doc`; `migrate()` is total (drops malformed keys/dirs).

### Links — explicit connections (save v2, conveyor-links plan phase A, 2026-09-28)

A **link** is one belt from one machine to the next, in WORLD tiles:

```js
doc.links = [{ id: 'l3', from: { prop: 'p10', port: 'out' }, to: { prop: 'p11', port: 'in' },
               path: [{ x: 2, y: 4, d: 'E' }, { x: 3, y: 4, d: 'E' }] }, ...]
```

- `prop` is a belt machine's id (INBOX, BAY, OUTBOX, SPLITTER, JOINER, MERGER, FILTER, LOOP) or `null` for
  an open end. `path` is the belt it rides, in flow order. Ports: `in` / `out`, plus the exits that mean
  something — a FILTER out-link carries `tags` (task types routed down it) and `else: true` (EVERYTHING
  ELSE); a LOOP out-link is `done`, `back` or `esc`. A `ring: true` link is one ring tile the old ring rule
  hooked that no belt run explains (two machines sharing a ring tile) — written down so nothing moves.
- **Compiler** (`Pipeline.compileRoutingPlan`): a geo WITH `links` hooks a machine only to the ring tiles of its
  own links (a belt passing a ring hooks nothing), reads FILTER routes / LOOP exits from ports (compass
  config on the prop is the fallback), warns `JUNCTION_TOUCH` for a belt beside a junction that is not one of
  its links, and `lineComponents` joins machines by their own links. A geo without links keeps the ring rule.
- **Derivation** (`Pipeline.deriveLinks(geo)`): today's ring rule written down as links, exact by
  construction — a derived floor compiles to the identical plan and hash (test/conveyor-links.test.js: the
  routing fixture corpus, every blueprint, a seeded fuzz).
- **Adoption**: a floor that never had links (a v1 save) derives them exactly on load and adopts them only when
  they compile to the identical plan (else `null`, and the ring rule stands — every old behaviour, TOO CLOSE
  included). Read with `station.links()` / `station.isLinked()`; `projectGeometry()` emits them in the LOCAL
  frame. Belts stay in the save, so an older build still routes a v2 save by tiles.
- **The floor keeps its links (phase B)**: after every edit `Pipeline.reconcileLinks` keeps each link the floor
  still stands behind (its belt laid tile for tile, its machines where it meets them), drops the rest (a cut or
  turned belt, a moved or removed machine — the belt stays, loose), and links every loose run that joins two
  machines: out of one (the footprint behind its first arrow, a junction's lane, its ring) and INTO another (a
  footprint, a junction's tile, the side or corner it stops at, or a linked belt that carries it on). A run that
  joins no two machines stays loose: on the floor, in no plan (`plan.belts` = link paths + junction tiles), so
  no crate rides it and no junction reads it as a lane. Derived links reconcile to themselves; reconcile is
  idempotent; a new link starting where a dropped one did inherits its id and ports.
- **Tools (phase B)**: BELT click-click (`connectBelt` = `planBelt` + `layBelt`) lays ONE link between the two
  machines clicked — its last tile is the destination's alone (not in the start machine's ring), and no tile but
  its own ends touches another junction. `moveProp` lifts and re-lays a machine's links (ids and ports kept;
  `syncJunctionCfg` rewrites a FILTER/LOOP's compass config from the new lanes) and reports `relaid` / `lost`;
  `removeProp` drops its links and leaves the belts loose (a machine put back at their end picks them up);
  `configureJunction` writes the new routes onto the junction's out-links. REFIT previews the lane before the
  click (`previewBelt`), names a belt's link or says it is loose, and dry-runs a placement on a probe copy
  (`connectionPreview` → `linkedPreview`) to say what it would connect.

### Layout engine — `LineLayout.layout(graph, floor)` (linelayout.js, conveyor-links phase C)

Pure, deterministic. Takes one line as a graph (`nodes: [{ id, t, w, h, pin? }]`, `links: [{ from: { node, port, tags?, else? }, to: { node } }]`)
and the floor (`rects` deck, `blocked` props, `belts` already laid, optional `junctions`) and answers `{ nodes: { id: { x, y } }, links, belts }`
— or `{ ok: false, error: 'NO_ROOM', needs: { w, h } }` (MAKE ROOM adds a tile of walking room round that), or
`{ ok: false, error: 'NO_ROUTE', link | why: 'SIDES' (a junction cannot seat its links), node }`.

- **Columns** = longest forward path from the start; a LOOP's way back (any link closing a cycle) never pushes a step right.
- **Lanes**: a SPLITTER/FILTER spreads its outputs round its own lane — in the compiler's E, S, W, N lane order, so a
  split's turn order and a filter's fallback lane survive the layout; a LOOP keeps done on its lane, escape below; a
  JOINER/MERGER sits on the middle of the lanes feeding it. Lane spacing tries 2, 3, then 4 rows (tightest that routes).
- **Junction sides** are settled before any belt: each link gets its own side — the one it wants (above = N, below = S,
  same lane = E out / W in, a way back N) where that side is free — and the order the compiler reads (E, S, W, N) is
  kept, so a machine or wall against a junction re-sides its lanes but never changes a split's turns or a filter's
  fallback. A layout that would reorder them is refused (`orderKept`), never returned.
- **Belts**: A* per link on flat arrays (a bend costs 2, a tile beside a third machine 1; of two equally cheap belts
  the shorter wins); the BELT tool's rules hold (arrival tile a BAY's alone, never beside a junction it does not
  serve). Main run first, ways back last; a link walled in by earlier belts is laid first on the next try.
- **Placement**: pinned nodes never move — the line forms round the first pin, each other machine keeping its place
  relative to the machine feeding it (a branch moves as one), stepping to the nearest clear lane or spot if taken;
  unpinned, the line is routed on an empty floor of its own and that shape goes to the first clear spot (rows top
  first) where no old belt runs into it and none of its belts sits beside another line's junction.
- Locked by test/line-layout.test.js: every blueprint, laid out fresh, routes EXACTLY as the stamped original; as many
  fit a fresh starter room as-is as the hand-drawn ones do (12 of 20 on 09-29; the rest in a room grown for them) and every machine
  and belt passes the station's own placement checks; on cluttered decks (free and pinned) every line it lays still
  routes the same; a junction pinned against a wall keeps its lane order or answers NO_ROUTE.
- Speed (measured 09-29): ~2 ms on average for a line on a cluttered 60×36 deck (worst seen 45 ms); 9–21 ms on a
  cluttered 160×100 one, pins far apart included. It runs on an edit, never per frame.

### Line edits — the Workflow panel builds the line (lineedit.js, conveyor-links phase D)

Every change to a line's SHAPE is one edit of its graph: `LineEdit.run(station, propId, op, args, { near, sizes })` reads the line
(`station.lineGraph(id)` — every machine pinned where it stands, every link with its belt, and the floor without the line),
applies the op, lays it out with the engine and writes it back in ONE undo slot (`station.applyLineLayout`). Ops: `insertStep`
(the + on a belt, by role) · `appendStep` · `addBranch` (around a step or on a belt; COPY TO EACH = SPLITTER + JOINER, TAKE
TURNS = SPLITTER + MERGER; a partner round a step is named like it) · `addLoop` (a REVIEWER + a LOOP gate: back until approved,
3 passes) · `addSorter` (a FILTER: CODE → ENGINEER, RESEARCH → RESEARCHER, everything else on) · `removeStep` (a split left
with one way folds away; a sorter's route step takes its route with it — that type then goes with everything else — and a
sorter left sorting nothing folds away) · `removeLoop` · `moveStep` (swap along a plain run) · `addOutbox` · `wrapLine` (a
lone BAY becomes INBOX → it → OUTBOX) · `tidy` (TIDY LINE: the whole line re-laid from its INBOX) · `newLine` (BUILD YOUR OWN
LINE: INBOX → a step → OUTBOX near the middle of the view) · `addArm` (another branch on a SPLITTER, up to three; the JOINER then
waits for it too) · `removeArm` (a whole branch out — every step on it; a split left with one way folds away, round a branch of
several steps too) · `addRoute` (a FILTER's step for CODE or RESEARCH when that type has no route, handing on to where
everything else goes) · `removeSorter` (the FILTER and every route step it sorts to, as one piece).

- ONLY WHAT CHANGED MOVES (the plan's decision 2): a belt the edit does not touch keeps its exact path (the engine's KEPT links);
  a new machine keeps its place relative to the machine feeding it and, when that spot is taken, tries a few clear spots. When
  that leaves the change no way through, the belts spread in rings — the lanes the edit names (a split's or a sorter's own,
  `e.loose`), then every belt of a machine the edit touched, then every belt of the line — and the result says so (`relaid`).
  Machines never move but by TIDY. A new branch / route lane may read in any place among its junction's lanes (`e.alts`: turns
  go round every branch, routes are named by their links), each tried at each ring. A new link is numbered after every link
  the floor held — an old link always keeps its id.
- NO ROOM WHERE THE LINE STANDS, but the edit fits with the line laid out afresh: the first click changes nothing
  (`NEEDS_TIDY`, `canTidy`) and the panel's button ARMS in place — ⌗ TIDY LINE TO FIT IT? — a second click within 4 s runs
  the edit with `opts.tidy` (the line laid out afresh round it, its INBOX fixed, one undo). Never a silent whole-line move.
- The floor shows the change: new machines flash, a machine an edit MOVED glides an outline from the footprint it left to the
  one it stands on (`drawMoves`, 760 ms), one it took out flashes red where it was.
- A refusal changes nothing and says what would help: TIDY LINE only when the same edit fits with the line re-laid, else a
  bigger room. `LineEdit.check` answers without laying anything, so the panel shows an impossible edit OFF with its reason.
- In the panel: the + on a belt (a step by role, a BRANCH either way, a SORTER in front of a step or the OUTBOX), a BAY's
  ROLE chips (`station.setPropRole`) and SHAPE THE LINE (earlier / later / a review / second opinion / share the load / remove),
  REMOVE THE REVIEW on a LOOP gate, a SPLITTER's ADD A BRANCH and ✕ per branch, a FILTER's + A STEP FOR CODE / RESEARCH (a
  type it has no route for) and REMOVE THE SORTER, MAKE IT A LINE on a lone BAY, + OUTBOX where a line that ends on a step has
  none, TIDY LINE in the footer. The Conveyors tab has BUILD YOUR OWN LINE. Locked by test/line-edit.test.js (every op on a real
  station, the audit's newsletter line built from edits alone, one undo each) and test/line-edit-panel.test.js.

### Ready-made lines, laid out to fit (conveyor-links phase E)

A shelf line is also a GRAPH: `station.blueprintGraph(id, { limits, maxIter })` — its machines with everything a stamp gives
them (roles, an INBOX's name and budget, junction routes / passes / verdict, the card's SET UP BEFORE YOU PLACE cap and tries)
and the links its drawn belts make. Where the DRAWN tile map fits at the click, Build mode stamps it as drawn
(`stampBlueprint` — presets keep using this, at their fixed spots). Where it does not, `LineEdit.placeBlueprint(station, id,
near, { stamp })` lays the same line out near the click: its tidy engine shape where a clear rectangle holds it, else anchored
on its INBOX (aimed half the line's length west of the click, so it lands centred) with every other machine stepping round
what stands there — one undo, routing exactly as the drawn line.

- A card whose drawn shape fits nowhere asks `LineEdit.canPlaceBlueprint` in the background (one line at a time, forgotten on
  every floor change) and says CHECKING WHERE IT FITS… then FITS LAID OUT — CLICK THE FLOOR WHERE YOU WANT IT, or NO ROOM with
  the size the engine needs; MAKE ROOM FOR IT builds the smaller of the drawn and the laid-out size. The red ghost of a line
  that fits laid out invites CLICK TO LAY IT OUT HERE.
- Every one of the 20 ready-made lines lands in a fresh starter room this way (the drawn tile maps: 12). Locked by
  test/line-place.test.js (each one routes exactly as the stamped original with the card's settings, one undo).

## Runtime (conveyor.js) — `Conveyor.create()`

A self-contained transport sim + renderer. Frame-agnostic: it's handed a belt map in whatever
tile frame the caller draws in (build.js = world coords, world.js = local coords), so one
factory powers both REFIT preview and the live world, each with its own box state.

- `tick(dtMs, nowMs, beltMap)` — advance boxes. Boxes are **never auto-spawned**: a box exists only
  for a real work-item dropped via `enqueueAt` (see *Work-item pipeline*). A box advances `progress`
  along its tile's dir; at `progress>=1` it steps to the next tile and adopts THAT tile's dir
  (corners), or sinks (fade) at an open end — firing `onDeliver` if it carries a payload.
  Deterministic — no RNG, no wall-clock (nowMs is injected).
- `enqueueAt(x,y,payload)` — place a real work-item box at a source tile; `dropWorkitem(id)` —
  early-sink a riding box whose run was superseded (it never delivers); `Conveyor.create({onDeliver})`
  — `onDeliver(box,x,y)` fires once when a payload box rides off the end.
- `drawBelts(ctx, nowMs, TILE, beltMap, liveSet?)` — each tile: rails on the cross-axis, tread chevrons
  scrolling in the flow direction (ported from v7 `F.beltH`, generalized to 4 dirs + 1 tile),
  drive-LED. Direction is legible at a glance. `liveSet` (from `Pipeline.liveTiles(plan)`) marks the
  tiles on a complete INTAKE→bound-BAY route: those render ENERGIZED (marching treads/chevron, blinking
  LED); the rest render COLD (frozen treads, no chevron, dark LED, dimmed) so an incomplete chain is
  visibly not running. Omitted → every tile draws live (legacy behavior).
- `drawBoxes(ctx, nowMs, TILE)` — riding crates with contact shadows; a short sink-fade at the end.

Belts draw at floor level (over the bake, under the lightmap); boxes just above, y-sorted with
agents/props.

## Builder (build.js)

`BELT` tool (key 7): **drag to lay a run** — flow follows the dominant drag axis (drag east → `E`
belts, drag up → `N`, …). Ghost previews the run + a flow arrow, green/red via validation.
RECLAIM removes belt tiles. Belts stay **quiet** until a real work-item rides them (no decorative flow).

## Cargo, motion & belt craft (polish pass)

The boxes encode the station's SEMANTIC COLOR ECONOMY — each box hashes deterministically (by id)
to a cargo type, weighted so loud colours stay rare: **utility/steel 34% · production/amber 30% ·
data/cyan 16% · command/red 13% · money/gold 7%**. All share one 2.5D `cargoChassis` (lit top face
+ shaded front face + leading-edge rim light keyed to travel dir); data is a flatter cassette and
money is stacked bullion (silhouette breaks for instant read). Per-box variety is `U.hash(''+id)`;
the only `nowMs` uses are the amber LED, command strobe, data read-head, and gold sheen — blooms
gate behind `globalAlpha>0.6` so fading boxes skip them.

**Motion** (`boxMotion`, translate-only — no `ctx.scale`): hash-phased ride bob, lean into travel,
bob-coupled contact shadow, spawn-pop (easeOutBack lift + alpha ramp via `t0`), a corner jolt on
heading change (`turn0`), and a sink that falls into the chute (slide in dir + fade + shrink shadow).

**Sim**: min-gap backpressure — a box never advances within `MIN_GAP` (0.82 tile) of the box ahead
(the occupancy index is kept LIVE across tile crossings, so two lanes converging on one tile in the same
tick can't both claim it — the second holds at its lane head), so work-items queue behind a stalled
one. Equal progress on one tile counts as blocked, broken by box id, so a tie can't ride as a pile.
Backpressure reaches **into the queue**: `enqueueAt` items wait in `pending` until their source tile has
`MIN_GAP` of clear room, then are born — a burst (a channel flurry, a cron fan-out) forms a visible line
instead of one stack of crates drawn on top of each other, and a busy source never stalls another's lane.
A source therefore emits at the belt's real capacity (~2 crates/sec); `pending` is capped at `MAX_PENDING`
(240, oldest shed) for the same reason `MAX_BOXES` exists. There is **no auto-spawn** — belts carry only
real work.

**Belt tiles** (`drawBelts` classifies each tile from the belt map): source = amber feeder hatch
(the belt's start, where an INTAKE feeds it); sink = dark chute mouth + lip shadow; corner = an elbow glyph bending
flow toward the exit; straight = axis-aware treads + a **dim-neutral** marching chevron (NOT an
economy accent — keeps cyan/green meaningful) + a small drive LED.

## Status

- **Stage 4a/4b (done):** directional belts + semantic cargo art + motion juice + min-gap
  backpressure; place/reclaim/undo/persist; REFIT + live world; deterministic sim; tests.
- **Work-item pipeline (done — Stages 1–2):** belts are the wiring of the agent work-pipeline. A
  real inbound message (Telegram) becomes a payload box via `enqueueAt`, rides the player-laid belts
  to the agent's desk, and fires `onDeliver`; a superseded run's box drops off the belt
  (`dropWorkitem`). The decorative auto-spawn was **removed** — every crate now means real work.
  Additive events: `workitem.placed/delivered/superseded`, `queue.status`. Plan:
  `docs/CONVEYOR_PIPELINE_PLAN.md`.
- **Junctions (done):** SPLITTER round-robins across its out-lanes; FILTER routes by the work-item's
  content tag (`routes[tag] || def`, never dropping); MERGER is a **lane funnel** — several lanes
  converge, every crate rides straight on. A merger has no config and combines nothing: the harness
  dispatches each work-item independently, so K crates in must be K crates out or the floor is lying.
  (It once buffered K and absorbed K−1 for a map-reduce barrier the server never performed — removed
  2026-07-26.) Real batching would need a defined reply target for a run merged from several chats;
  that is an open product question, not a belt feature.
- **Work lines / agentic graphs (done — 2026-07-27):** a dock's OUTPUT is the next dock's INPUT. Until this
  landed the floor was a *dispatcher*: it picked ONE agent per inbound message, the bay consumed the crate, and
  every bay drawn downstream of it was scenery — `INTAKE → researcher → writer → OUTBOX` ran only the
  researcher. `compileRoutingPlan` now also emits `chains { agentId → { tile, next[], outbox, deadEnd } }`, and
  `chainNext(plan, agentId, ctx, pick)` walks the belts from a dock's SHIP tile to the next dock, mirroring
  crate physics exactly: a FILTER downstream of a dock branches on the **output's** tag (route the result by
  what it turned out to be), a SPLIT round-robins, and **one output crate is one downstream run** (K in, K out).
  `sidecar/routing/chain.js` executes it for channel messages (all four hubs), scheduled routines
  (`cron-driver` `advanceChain`) and Run Now; an in-app COMMS turn is owned by the BROWSER, so `chat.js`
  drives the same hops itself against `GET /api/routing/chain`. All four surfaces run the same line.
  The reply that leaves the station is the LAST stage's.
  - **The handoff prompt lives in `pipeline.js`** — the pure module the sidecar executor and the browser BOTH
    load. Two copies of that string would let one floor produce different runs on different surfaces.
  - **Every stage is attributed to the agent that produced it.** `row()` takes `opts.who` and a work-line turn
    persists its `agentId`; stamping stage two's work with the entry dock's name is a fabricated turn, the same
    law that stopped the hub writing a downstream reply into the entry dock's transcript.
  - **A stream can hold several run rows.** Hops share the routine's `cron-<runId>` stream so the session shows
    the whole line — so anything deriving a session's title/agent must pick the row whose runId the stream is
    NAMED after, never whichever it reads first (that titled routines with the internal handoff prompt).
  - **A DOCK NEVER EATS ITS OWN OUTPUT.** A lane running along a dock's edge touches several ring tiles; the
    handoff rides through all of them and is consumed only by a foreign dock. Compiler and engine hold the
    same rule, which is what makes a self-loop structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely.
  - **`CHAIN_CYCLE` is a BLOCKING error**, and it is invisible to `detectCycle`: A shipping into B's dock and
    B shipping into A's are two separate lanes with no belt cycle anywhere — the loop exists only across the
    docks (consume here, respawn there), and it is an infinite chain of PAID runs.
  - **A CHAIN NEVER GATES THE REPLY.** Hop cap (6), chain spend cap ($2), a failed/empty stage, E-STOP — every
    stop delivers the last good output plus an honest note naming where the line stopped. Same law as
    "no belt → work still runs": a broken stage 3 must not swallow stage 2's answer.
  - The line runs INSIDE the hub's inflight record, so E-STOP and a superseding message reach the downstream
    stages; and `visited` refuses to run an agent twice even if the plan is re-posted mid-chain.
  - Legibility: dock→dock lanes render ENERGIZED (they carry real crates), `BAY_NOT_FED` no longer shames a
    stage-two dock (it is fed by an agent, not by a door), and a non-terminal stage no longer ALSO ships a
    crate at the OUTBOX — its product *is* the handoff.
- **Later:** RPG economy.
