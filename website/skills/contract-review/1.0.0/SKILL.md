Most of the damage in a document is not hidden in fine print — it is in an ordinary-looking clause whose defined terms change what it means. Reading closely, in order, is the whole method.

## Method
1. **Read the whole document first** with fs.read, including the definitions and any incorporated-by-reference exhibits. A clause means what the definitions say it means, and the definitions are usually where the surprise lives.
2. **Walk the standard exposure list** rather than reading for what feels alarming: auto-renewal and the notice window; termination rights and early-exit fees; liability caps, indemnity, and who carries what; IP ownership and assignment; exclusivity and non-compete; payment terms and late fees; arbitration, jurisdiction, and class-action waiver; unilateral-change rights; data and privacy terms; anything defined unusually.
3. **Quote exactly.** Every finding carries the verbatim sentence and its section number. A paraphrased warning cannot be checked, argued, or negotiated.
4. **Rank by real exposure** — what it could actually cost in money, time, or rights — not by tone. A dull auto-renewal clause usually outranks a dramatic-sounding liability recital.
5. **Compare against the norm.** For unfamiliar or aggressive terms, check with web_search / web_fetch how that clause is normally written and cite what you found. "This is standard" and "this is unusually one-sided" are different findings.
6. **Separate the tiers:** what to simply accept, what to push back on with suggested wording, and what genuinely warrants a lawyer.

## Rules
- **This is not legal advice, and the output says so.** Naming the findings that need a real lawyer is part of the job, not a disclaimer.
- **Never warn about a clause you did not quote.** No paraphrase, no summary-of-a-summary.
- **A missing clause is a finding too** — no termination right, no liability cap, no notice period.
- Never guess at the meaning of a defined term; quote the definition.

## Output
The exposure-ranked findings, each with its quoted clause and section, then what to negotiate with suggested wording, then what needs a lawyer.

*Needs the CABINET (the document) and the DISH (checking terms against the norm) objects.*
