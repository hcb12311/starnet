/* STARNET — voice.js : two-way voice for the COMMS panel.

   INPUT  (click-to-talk): click the mic once to start recording and again to finish; the completed take feeds the text
          straight through Chat.send — identical to typing — so all of chat.js's
          busy / purpose / task-vs-talk logic is reused with zero duplication.
   OUTPUT (agent voice): when an agent speaks a conversational reply (the same moment
          it shows a speech bubble via World.say), it is spoken aloud using the agent's
          assigned built-in voice, or the existing station recipe when unassigned.
          Personality controls the words independently of the chosen voice.

   STT prefers the recorder → /api/stt (server Whisper) wherever the mic can be recorded — Chrome's
   browser-native SpeechRecognition is Google-served and CENSORS profanity to asterisks with no opt-out,
   so it is only the fallback (no MediaRecorder, `?stt=web`, or a sidecar with no STT credential).
   TTS is NEURAL-ONLY via the sidecar /api/tts. The client always asks the sidecar when the
   speaker is on — the sidecar owns the tier ladder (run-provider native voice → OpenRouter/
   Gemini/OpenAI → a free keyless neural floor) and decides what it can serve. There is NO
   robotic browser-speechSynthesis fallback: if every neural tier fails (total network loss),
   the chunk is simply SKIPPED (silence) and the honest degrade reason is pinned on the
   speaker-toggle tooltip. The reply text is always visible in COMMS — silence over cringe.

   Graceful degradation: no SpeechRecognition → the mic button hides; the speaker toggle needs
   only Audio + fetch (never speechSynthesis). A failed neural chunk plays nothing (the reply
   still shows as text + a room bubble); no permanent latch — the next reply re-probes. */
