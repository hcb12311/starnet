/* STARNET — remoteview.js : the picture of this station that a paired phone sees.

   StarNet Remote's phone app has a STATION view. The station is drawn by THIS page (the sidecar has no
   renderer), so this page draws it: World.renderStill() runs the real scene pass — floor, walls, props, the
   crew where they really stand, light — onto an offscreen canvas framed on the whole station, and the still is
   handed to the sidecar (POST /api/remote/view), which passes it to the phone over the sealed channel.

   WHEN IT DRAWS (an idle station does no extra work):
     · GET /api/remote/view says whether Remote is on and whether a phone is looking right now.
     · Remote off: nothing is drawn; it looks again once a minute.
     · Remote on: one picture when the floor is up (so a phone that opens later has something, stamped with its
       age), then a fresh one every few seconds only while a phone is looking. A station that is slow to draw
       is drawn less often, so the phone's picture never makes the desk stutter.

   TRUTH RULE: the picture is whatever the real renderer drew at that moment, stamped by the sidecar with the
   time it arrived. Nothing is staged for the phone, and the phone shows the picture's age.

   Plain init()/reset(), never emits, fail-open (a failed draw or upload changes nothing). */
