/* test/conveyor-ease.test.js — CONVEYORS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND AND FIX (Andrew, 2026-09-30: "I constantly get messages of people
   confused about conveyors … if the output is terrible and not consistent … how the user can fix the conveyor system to their
   liking" → "EASE OF USE AND UNDERSTANDABILITY the BIGGEST major concern").

   Locked here:
     · A STEP'S INSTRUCTIONS SAY WHAT THEY ARE — issue #28 asked "are these BAY instructions being used instead of the Agent's
       Purpose or in addition to it?": the BAY card names the agent, quotes its own purpose, and says DOES is ADDED on top;
     · SEND IT A JOB — the INBOX card opens on the plain way to put work into a line (#28: "I still haven't figured out how to add a
       new work item to an INBOX"): the same real job as RUN ONE REAL JOB, the typed text is also the line's test job;
     · THE JOB, READ BACK — the whole result (never 80 characters) and every step's own reply, read from its run by runId;
     · THE OUTBOX IS TOLD — the panel promised "the result lands in the OUTBOX"; a clean delivered job is now folded into the
       OUTBOX's ledger (only COMMS' INBOX card did that before). */
