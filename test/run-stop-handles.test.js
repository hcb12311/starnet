/* node test/run-stop-handles.test.js — which runs get a stop-by-id handle (QA 2026-10-02 + review).
   Every run runOnce drives with its own id (routine fires, line hops, hubs, step tests) is stoppable and steerable by id
   (see test/cancel-host-run.e2e.test.js for the live proof). A DELEGATED worker is not: the subagent manager owns its stop
   (interrupt, cancelChildren) and it reads steering from its own buffer — a desk STEER by its id answered "Sent" and was
   never read, and a desk STOP bypassed the manager. */
