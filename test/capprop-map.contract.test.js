/* node test/capprop-map.contract.test.js — the per-prop-id contract for the object=capability spine.

   Closes Atlas finding e08db5b6: only STUDIO had a per-prop-id lock (test/g1bprops.test.js); the other
   20 cap-prop ids in frontend/app/worldmodel.js CAP_PROP_MAP were guarded only at the OBJECTTYPE level
   (test/capgate.test.js / test/routing.b5.test.js build synthetic stations from objectTypes, NOT from prop
   ids). So dropping e.g. `vault` or `comms_beacon` from CAP_PROP_MAP would ship silently — the objectType
   (cabinet/dish) still passes those tests. This table-driven lock fails BY NAME on any such drop/rename:

     (1) every CAP_PROP_MAP entry resolves to a real, registered CAP_REGISTRY objectType (no dangling cap), and
     (2) each documented cap-prop id maps to EXACTLY the objectType it is meant to (the DOCUMENTED table below),
         so a silent re-point (desk -> cabinet) or a dropped id fails here, not in a demo.

   Pure + fast (no DOM, no boot): the map is static data and the registry is a frozen object. */
