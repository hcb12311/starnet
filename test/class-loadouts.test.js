/* node test/class-loadouts.test.js — Class Loadouts (the shared-gear model).

   A class = model tier + reasoning effort + skill package + the SHARED STATION GEAR it draws on. Andrew's rule
   (2026-07-02): "the only prop a specialized or secondary agent needs is its own desk; it's allowed to use other
   props with the overseer." So a class's `kit` is NOT issued per-agent — it names shared station gear used under
   the overseer (informational in the dossier, and the gate for the class's skill availability). Two halves,
   matching kitout.test.js's discipline:
     1. GROUNDED-CATALOG unit tests (real assertions on pure modules): the shared catalog is well-formed and
        HONEST — every kit objectType is a real CAP_REGISTRY key, every skill slug is a real bundled recipe, and
        every skill's `requires` is satisfied by its class's declared gear (Law 4: grounded classes only).
     2. UNIT tests for the wiring the backend depends on: catalog.compose(agentSkills) is an ADD-only union that
        respects the budget with the package first; the sidecar roster passes skills/effort through; and a
        specialist's skills gate on STATION-WIDE gear (not its desk-room) so a desk-only specialist still gets them.
     3. SOURCE-LEVEL invariants for the browser-only summon path (app.js / build.js are IIFEs over live DOM, so —
        like kitout.test.js — we lock the honesty-critical wiring by reading the source): NO per-agent placement. */

/* ---------- 1b. ROSTER CONTENT: 36 curated builtins + 21 archetypes, seals/codes, sanity ----------
   Third wave 2026-08-03 adds the SHIP-YOUR-APP lane (apptester / auditor / deployer / dbhelper — the jobs an
   AI-assembled app actually fails at: nothing tested it, keys shipped to the browser, it will not build on the
   host, the database is readable by anyone), the marketing SUB-NICHES (emailmarketer / adcopy / landingwriter,
   which the one generic "marketer" was standing in for), and the business roles (support on the roster;
   hiring / processwriter / pitchwriter in the archive). The security auditor was PROMOTED out of the archive
   and re-aimed at app security rather than generic file sweeps.
   Expansion 2026-08-03 (supersedes the 2026-07-16 business-grade redesign): the 12-class business bar had
   narrowed the VISIBLE roster to job titles and folded everything else into a collapsed archive, which read
   as bare. The bar is now "does this class own an outcome nobody else on the roster owns", which admits:
     • CAPABILITY classes only this harness can offer — pilot (drives a real browser), foreman (splits work
       across the crew), nightwatch (the unattended shift), harvester (the web into a dataset);
     • LIFE & MONEY classes — paralegal, negotiator, jobhunter, ghostwriter, sentinel (public exposure),
       registrar (the people), provisioner (the week's food), taskmaster (commitments), + archive medic/diplomat;
     • the BUILD lane — drafter (a fuzzy idea into a testable spec);
     • PROMOTED deep cuts whose demand was never niche — chief / envoy / tutor.
   scribe joins liaison/publicist/bookkeeper as RETIRED — writer and ghostwriter are its strict supersets, and a
   near-duplicate would shadow them in the scout's matcher. curator and muse were deliberately KEPT (distinct
