/* node test/browser-station-privacy.test.js — ONLY the Commander at COMMS may drive the shared station browser.
   Release review 2026-09-30: the station browser carries the Commander's sign-ins and open tabs, and 'interactive' is
   also the surface of Telegram/Discord chats with approvals on (including allowed group chats), STARNET REMOTE phone
   runs and group sessions. Those must browse in a private browser. Pins the composition-root wiring (an injected-deps
   unit test cannot see it): the station view is granted only on surface 'interactive' AND stationBrowser:true, and only
   the COMMS /api/run call passes stationBrowser. Plus the view itself: a non-interactive request gets no station view. */
